## About Me
- 🌱 [OPF Academy Alum.](https://www.opf.degree/academy) (part of Cohort 7)
- Data hobbies: I love a linear programming problem, defining/architecting business systems, and enabling & empowering others around me. I love me a good SQL DAG.
- Non-data hobbies: CrossFit, Android: Netrunner, Modern German History

## Operating Approach
- I do my best work usually M-F, 7:45a PST/PDT to 4:15p PST/PDT. When commuting into an office, I usually start later and end later (8:30a - 5:30p)
- I prefer Discord/Slack/Teams to emails.
- I prefer Notion/Google Drive to Egnyte/OneDrive.
- I prefer a 25 minute one-on-one meeting to a longer stand-up or team meeting. Biweekly or weekly depending on whom I am meeting with.
- I like meetings batched, in manageable doses, and with an agenda/purpose clearly defined.
- I generally like to gather context up front (reading docs, asking questions, a focused meeting). I then prefer to dive in, try things myself, or grapple with the task. Once I’ve done that, I’ll usually want to review/ask for support 
- I love deep questions (work or non-work, existential or foundational data stack stuff); I don't mind returning to topics during a winding conversation or after some reflection.

### What Motivates Me?
- Complex problems – I love systems, finding order, and solving a good puzzle. It’s why I love data!
- Enabling & Empowering – I love when my work can help another confidently and competently use data for good in the world. It’s rewarding to share my knowledge & passions.
- Structure – I love time for meeting, time for solo work. I love systems & structured time. 

### What Demotivates Me?
- Context Switching – I love novelty in my puzzles & tasks, but too much or too frequent prevents me from doing my best work
- Politics (inter-personal) – I am a direct person, so situations that require social nuance or influence aren’t my strong-suite
- Going too fast – I am all for going fast & breaking things, but it isn’t my nature. I like to be methodical, beginning with an end in mind (even if the plan changes!).

## An Incomplete List of Personal Values
- Candor – I love honesty. Direct, deep, & meaningful conversations are some of my favorite things in life, even if they are difficult. 
- Passion – I love when people are passionate about something, and even more when they can share that passion with others.
- Service – I enable and empower others to confidently and competently use their data to improve the world around us. I love it when others show the same value/mission.
- Expertise – I strive to have both a broad base of general knowledge/skills, as well as a few key areas with deep expertise. I like knowing why, being able to explain or articulate something dense, and the ah-ha moments in life.

## How I Prefer Feedback & Recognition
- The more direct the better. I love actionable feedback even if it seems harsh.
- I like lots of feedback. I try to ask for it frequently.
- I prefer recognition privately, one-on-one, rather than in a large group setting. Face-to-face, synchronously, or asynchronously doesn’t matter to me. 
- Authentic praise or recognition means more to me than public praise, so however is unique to you will mean more to me!
